			<h1>Fediverse Blocked Instance List</h1>
            <h4>Defederation Policy</h4>
			<p>yay</p>
			<p>The main goal of blocking is keeping omada a pleasant comfortable place. When another instance disturbs that it may be defederated.</p>
			<p>Instances are being defederated for reasons like harassment, spamming, posting illegal/<strong>strongly immoral</strong> content or generally their terms/rules go against <a href="rules/index.html">ours;</a> but usually not for only being dumb, like having dumb opinions, unless those opinions are lead to being harmful.
            <p>Users are expected to use their own moderation tools if they take personal issue with certain users or instances. </p>
            <h3>the block list</h3>
            Since maintaining the blocklist constantly is kind of tough, and I'm lazy <br>
            We will provide a tool that shows the list instead, <a href="https://fba.ryona.agency/?reverse=fedi.omada.cafe">the list(tm)</a> <br>
            This also shows current and past blocks and is constantly updated <br> <br>
            <p>I also let other instance admins appeal blocks, to appeal a block: just contact <a href="https://fluffery.omada.cafe">Fluffery</a></p>
