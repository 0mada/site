	<p>Omada is mainly a 9b9t group</p>
      	<p>We were also known as Team Woo, in our early days. Although we changed the name after getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB1_w_6LgnI">greifed</a> by Dugs2, R0ro931, and DiscoShampue.</p>
	<p>There was a short period of inactivity after the greif of Specus Ruina 1 and came back in Fall 2021 and went public and stayed public until around January 2022.</p>
