	<p>Omada is mainly a 9b9t group</p>
      	<p>We were also known as Team Woo, in our early days. Although we changed the name after getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB1_w_6LgnI">greifed</a> by Dugs2, R0ro931, and DiscoShampue.</p>
	<p>There was a short period of inactivity after the greif of Specus Ruina 1 and came back in Fall 2021 and went public and stayed public until around January 2022.</p>

	<h1>Story of Omada Bases</h1>
	<p><b>Midnight Mansion/Infinite Manor:</b> A big obby cube in the Spawn region of 9b9t and is the place where Omada was started with <a href="https://namemc.com/profile/MidnightWolf333.1">Wombatyoo</a> and was greifed by pls_no over a dumb argument</p>
	<p><b>Specus "0.5"</b> a spawn base that served as the oringal home of <a href="https://namemc.com/profile/GypsySkull.1">Skull</a> when he first joined 9b9t</p>
	<p><b>Specus Ruina I:</b> An underground base started by <a href="https://namemc.com/profile/GypsySkull.1">Skull</a> who later invited Fluffery, WhatsVape, Sildrio, Shade, and Skully which was griefed by Dugs2 over Fluffery greifing his stash, which prompted the renaming of Team Woo to Omada</p>
	<p><b>Specus Flora</b> a short lived base that was abandoned and later greifed by Zoodoo</p>
	<p><b>Specus Ruina II</b> After this base got greifed we decided to take a month break, after we came back, We went as a public group and many of our newer members have joined in this period, we did some pvp and then went back to base building</p>
	<p><b>Yttrium x Omada Spawn Base</b> right after our pvp frenzy October-December 2021, we became close allys of and with Yttrium, an ec.me group, we made a base at 9b spawn that lasted for about a month and then we travelled to a new base.</p>
